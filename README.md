# `oh-my-zsh` script

## What is this?

A script file to install (oh-my-zsh)[https://ohmyz.sh/], and then install:
- (powerlevel10k)[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k]
- (zsh-autosuggestions)[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions]
- (zsh-syntax-highlighting)[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting]
automatically.

I made this to speed up this process when instaling a different Linux Distribution.

## How to run

You can download the script file and run it with 
```
bash .zsh-setup.sh
```
Or get it from github directly with
```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathanjms/oh-my-zsh-script/main/zsh-setup.sh)
```

## Future Plans

Currently no future plans, but if i come accross any plugins I like, I may add them to the script. Another idea is to allow the user to input which plugins to add automatically, but at the moment these are my favourite which end up on every `oh-my-zsh` terminal I use.
